# Project Overview:
## Afolabi Saheedat's Portfolio
This project showcases my skills as a frontend engineer based on all that I have learnt in the last 4 months and a little more. It is a portfolio website that tells you a little about me and shows what I am capable of doing and achieving.
## Features and Functionality:
- **Home Section:** A visually appealing introduction to who I am and what I do. 
- **About Me Section:** Information about my background, experience, and interests.
- **Skills Section:** A display of my technical skills, professional skills and proficiency levels.
- **Projects Section:** A showcase of my most recent projects.
- **Contact Me Section:** A way for users to get in touch with me through my email.
- **Footer:** Contains my social media links.

## Technologies Used:
- HTML
    - HTML provides the skeletal structure of my webpage. In an attempt to make my page more accessible, I tried to use ARIA-lables, according to the WAI-ARIA guidelines. Semantic html was also used.
- CSS
    - CSS is used for the design of my page, to make it look overall better. Keyframe animations and transitions were used.
- JAVASCRIPT
    - Javascript was used to implement functionalities for my portfolio. Functionlaities that include sidebar, scroll-animations, text-animations and it also served as the server-side validation for my form in that it enables user to fill the form and send me messages from the form. Emailjs was used to make this happen.

## Roadmap and future enhancements:
In the future, I plan to enhance this project by:
- Rewriting the html in a better way(if possible)
- Rewriting the css in a simpler way e.g using tailwind instead of pure css.
- Using better animations for the entire projects.
- Adding more and better enhanced projects to the portfolio.
- Implementing interactive features for a better user experience.
- Optimizing the performance and responsiveness of the website.
- Improve its accessibilty and ensure that more people can use it.
- Improve it's overall look
