## Roadmap and future enhancements:
In the future, I plan to enhance this project by:
- Rewriting the html in a better way(if possible)
- Rewriting the css in a simpler way e.g using tailwind instead of pure css.
- Using better animations for the entire projects.
- Adding more and better enhanced projects to the portfolio.
- Implementing interactive features for a better user experience.
- Optimizing the performance and responsiveness of the website.
